The variables for this database come from collected accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw sifgnals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

From the set of variables that were estimated from these signals we keep only: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The train and test data were combined (and named using the variable names in feature.txt) and corresponding subject and activity data were added to the data frame. The activity values were named.

These data were averaged by each subject and activity.
The final variables are
